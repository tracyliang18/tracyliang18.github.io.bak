<p>He pulled a phone from his pocket and held it up for me to see. An iPhone. <em>His</em> iPhone.</p>

<p>"Oh no! I'm so sorry," I commiserated. My brother loved his blackberry and loved the attention he got for loving it. He loves underdogs. And the Lakers from the 80's. His wife, daughter, son all had iPhones but he would not.</p>

<p>He works at a specialized construction firm with a few hundred employees. IT wanted to pull the plug on the blackberry server. They forced the remaining two blackberry holdouts into iPhones. How times have changed.</p>

<p>We can only hope that his Zune keeps working forever. He loves it.</p>
