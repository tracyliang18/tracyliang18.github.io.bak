## Prose.io for Static github Sites

This is a jekyll blog. I'm composing this post at  [prose.io](http://prose.io/). I'm not even sure if I'm doing it correctly but if you are reading this I eventually figured it out.

Prose lets you auth with github and edit your content. It's a little bit like working in a CMS like wordpress but with all the benefits of a statically generated site. I  suppose once I save and publish this post it'll get commited to my repository and the jekyll site generation will happen.

Here goes nothing...

Ok, I clicked "Unpublished" and it changed to "Published" - I checked github and didn't see anything - then I clicked the icon of the floppy disk to save. It prompted me for a commit message and now I see it on github.
