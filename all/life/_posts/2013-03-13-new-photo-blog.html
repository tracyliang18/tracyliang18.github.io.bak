<p>Decided to give squarespace a try for my new photography blog:</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.shotbydan.com">Dan Hixon Photography Blog</a></p>

<p>So far so good. As a web developer It's tough paying for a service like this but I'm trying to let that angst parlay into more motivation to blog.</p>
